Hi, I'm Seongsu.Â Thank you for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a second-year integrated Ph.D. student in the [Aritificial Intelligence department](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (Postech)! I am also a member of [ML lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/), where my supervisor is [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home).

My research interests include integrating AI into scientific research and using AI to uncover scientific facts. Also I am interested in physical and chemical concepts like solid state physics, simulation dynamics and molecular science, and also mathematical concepts like group theory and geometry. Recently, I am focusing on intergrating [Geometrical Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/) into the molecular science.

**\[NewsðŸš€\]** *'24. Jul* one paper, "Gaussian Plane-Wave Neural Operator For Electron Density Estimation," has been accepted to ICML 2024.
