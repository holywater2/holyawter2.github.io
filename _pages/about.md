Hi, I'm Seongsu. Thank you for stopping by! 👋 The spelling of my name in Korean is "성수" and it is pronounced as [sʌŋ-su:].

I am currently a second-year integrated Ph.D. student in the [Aritificial Intelligence department](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (Postech)! I am also a member of [ML lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/), where my supervisor is [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home).

My research interests include integrating AI into scientific research and using AI to uncover scientific facts. Also, I am interested in physical and chemical concepts like solid state physics, simulation dynamics and molecular science, and also mathematical concepts like group theory and geometry. Recently, I am focusing on generative modeling for materials and ab initio based quantum chemisty such as density functional theroy (DFT) or variational Monte Carlo (VMC).

I believe that AI will effectively reduce the complexity of calculations in physics and chemistry, especially in areas like multi-objective optimization problems, challenges in establishing ansatzes, modeling interactions and governing equations, and handling intractable computations. I am studying and researching these possibilities.

I am always open to discussion, so please feel free to reach out anytime.
